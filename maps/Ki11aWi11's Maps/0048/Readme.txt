Hi,

First off thankyou for downloading my new map D-Day 0048. This map is set during D-Day at 0048, the time when the first paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division leapt from their C-47 Skytrains to assault the German positions in Normandy, France. 

This map is set up with two different configurations for the US Airborne Team. The first configuration is the ordinary ground spawning where players simply spawn on the ground. The second however is a parachute spawn where you spawn just next to any of the C-47 aircraft as if you just exited the plane. For this version to work however, you need to turn fall damage off!

Simply find in the config file in the dist folder of your pyspades server the line:

'fall_damage' : true,

and replace it with 

'fall_damage' : false,

To choose the parachute spawn configuration, simply copy the "d day 0048.vxl" and "d day 0048 parachute spawns.txt" to the maps folder and then rename the text file "d day 0048.txt"

Once you have done this the maps will be ready to play once you simply add the name of the map to the map rotation in the config file.

Regards
